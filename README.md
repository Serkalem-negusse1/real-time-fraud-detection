![Fraud Detection](images/fraudalert.png)

This project enhances the detection of fraudulent activities in e-commerce and bank credit transactions using machine learning. It involves advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment through Flask and Dash for real-time monitoring.

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is essential in e-commerce and banking to prevent financial losses and maintain customer trust. This project leverages machine learning to predict fraudulent activities in transaction datasets.

### Key Tasks:

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, clean data, and perform feature engineering.
   - Merge datasets for geolocation-based fraud analysis.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Train multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

3. **Model Explainability**:
   - Utilize SHAP and LIME for interpreting model predictions.
   - Generate visual explanations for decision-making.

4. **Model Tracking with MLflow**:
   - Track model training experiments using MLflow.
   - Log parameters, metrics, and model artifacts for better reproducibility.
   - Visualize model performance using MLflow UI.
